# Attention-Guided Multi-Scale Convolution for IRDrop Estimation in VLSI Designs (IR-Hunter)
## Overview
## Prerequisites
Dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

PyTorch is not included in requirements.txt, and you could install it following the instruction on PyTorch homepage https://pytorch.org/.

DGL is also not included in requirements.txt, and it is required for net delay prediction only. You could install it following the instruction on DGL homepage https://www.dgl.ai/pages/start.html.

Our experiments run on Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11. Other versions should work but are not tested.
