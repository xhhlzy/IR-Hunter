## Prerequisites
Dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

PyTorch is not listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install it by following the official instructions provided on the PyTorch website.(https://pytorch.org/)

Our experiments were conducted using Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11. Although other versions are likely to work, they haven't been verified.
